This web application solves the daily dilemma of **"What should I eat today?"** by using real-time weather information. Users can receive recommendations for Korean dishes that best suit the current weather in their city and even access a recipe video all at once.

### 1. 🌡️ Real-time Weather-Based Recommendations
- **Worldwide City Search:** Utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time data on the current weather, temperature, and country for any city a user enters.

- **Weather-Tailored Menu Suggestions:** Recommends intuitive, context-appropriate Korean dishes based on the weather conditions (e.g., clear, rain, snow) and temperature, such as 'Pajeon on a rainy day' or 'Naengmyeon on a hot day.'

### 2. 🎬 User-Focused Features
- **Embedded Cooking Tutorials:** Every recommended dish comes with a YouTube recipe tutorial that users can follow immediately, making it easy for anyone to prepare the meal.

- **Clear Country Name Display:** Provides clear information by converting country codes received from the API (e.g., KR) into full country names like 'Republic of Korea.'

- **Robust Error Handling:** Ensures a stable user experience by displaying a clear alert message if a user searches for a non-existent city or if the data fetch fails.
